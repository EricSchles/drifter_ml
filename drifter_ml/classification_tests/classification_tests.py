        Parameters
        ----------
        y_true : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
          Ground truth (correct) target values.
        y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
          Estimated targets as returned by a classifier
        labels : list, optional
          The set of labels to include when average != binary, and their order
          if average is None.  Labels present in the data can be excluded, for
          example to calculate a multiclass average ignoring a majority negative
          class, while labels not present in the data will result in 0 components
          in a macro average. For multilabel targets, labels are column indices.
          By default, all labels in y_true and y_pred are used in sorted order.
        pos_label : str or int, 1 by default
          The class to report if average='binary' and the data is binary.  If
          the data are multiclass or multilabel, this will be ignored; setting
          labels=[pos_label] and average != 'binary' will report scores for
          that label only.
        average : string, 
          [None, 'binary'(default), 'micro', 'macro', 'samples', 'weighted']
          This parameter is required for multiclass/multilabel targets.  If None,
          the scores for each class are returned.  Otherwise, this determines the
          type of averaging performed on the data.
          
          'binary' : string
             Only report results for the class specified by pos_label.  This is
             applicable only if targets (y_{true, pred}) are binary.
          'micro' : string
             Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives, 
             false negatives and false positives.
          'macro' : string
             Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean. 
             This does not take label imbalance into account.
           'weighted' : string
             Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted by
             support (the number of true instances for each label).  This alters 
             'macro' to account for label imbalance; it can result in an F-score 
             that isnot between precision and recall.
           'samples' : string
             Calculate metrics for each instance, and find their average (only
             meaningful for multilabel classification where this differs from 
             accuracy_score).
        sample_weight: array-like

    The general goal of this class it to test classification 
    algorithms.  
    The tests in this class move from simple to sophisticated:

    * cross_val_average : the average of all folds must be above some number
    * cross_val_lower_boundary : each fold must be above the lower boundary
    * lower_boundary_per_class : each class must be above a given lower boundary the lower boundary per class can be different
    * cross_val_anomaly_detection : the score for each fold must have a deviance from the average below a set tolerance
    * cross_val_per_class_anomaly_detection : the score for each class for each fold must have a deviance from the average below a set tolerance
    
    As you can see, at each level of sophistication we need more data to get
    representative sets.  But if more data is available, then we are able
    to test increasingly more cases.  The more data we have to test against,
    the more sure we can be about how well our model does.  
    
    Another lense to view each classes of tests, is with respect to stringency.
    If we need our model to absolutely work all the time, it might be important
    to use the most sophisticated class - something with cross validation, per class.
    It's worth noting, that increased stringency isn't always a good thing.
    Statistical models, by definition aren't supposed to cover every case perfectly.
    They are supposed to be flexible.  So you should only use the most strigent
    checks if you truly have a ton of data.  Otherwise, you will more or less
    'overfit' your test suite to try and look for errors.  Testing in machine learning
    like in software engineering is very much an art.  You need to be sure to cover
    enough cases, without going overboard.
